title: Blog features I want to implement
---

* Want to drop the complicated internal file naming system. Should not have to name the file by date.
* Implement a light/dark mode
* The front page should just have a list of titles of the posts, along with date
* Edited date should also be obtained from commit history
* Allow the bloglist on the front page to be ordered by ascending or descending date of publishing
